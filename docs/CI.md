# CircleCI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is used for continuous integration.

To run tests locally using [CircleCI Local CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/), first install the library

```
$ brew install circleci
```

Run the tests as CircleCI would run them

```
$ circleci local execute --job ruby-3.0
```
